            <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <p>Fully custom machines<br>
                At Do Something Great, the desire to have the best equipment available has proven difficult. It was a
                struggle until Legends used the expertise of Watson's gym equipment, who met all of our high standards
                and built all of their equipment from the ground up at their nearby factory.
                <br><br>
                Old School Dumbbells<br>
                Few people have the strength to push 90 kg of dumbbells. However, you can at least do so at Legends Gym.
                because the South West's heaviest dumbbells are at Legends. And if you're not quite ready for that, we
                also have weights from 1 to 90 kg that are all constructed in the traditional old-school solid iron way.
                <br><br>
                Eleiko calibrated plates<br>
                Our selection of calibrated steel Eleiko power lifting plates is extensive. For ease of use and
                recognition, they are designed and coloured in accordance with the Global Power Lifting Alliance and the
                International Power Lifting Federation. Plates weighing from 500 grams to 25 kilograms plates are
                available. Fractional plates are necessary for your personal best or pre-competition lifts because they
                allow you to make incremental improvements to your power lifting regimens while remaining confident that
                the weight you are lifting is what is on the bar.
                <br><br>
                Olympic Bumper Plates<br>
                Composed entirely of rubber The Olympic Bumper Plates from Bisonâ„¢ are made to last. Any powerlifter or
                Olympic lifter must have the ability to raise these weights overhead or drop them from a strong deadlift
                without hurting the floor or the weights.
                <br><br>
                Cardiovascular Facilities<br>
                Although Do Something Great specialises in traditional weightlifting, we offer a small area specifically
                designated for aerobic exercise since we want to meet the demands of every member. We have all the
                equipment you need, including spin bikes, cross trainers, stair climbers, and tread mills.
                <br><br>

                Buffalo Squat Bar, Rogue Safety Squat Bar, Texas Dead Lift Bar, Texas 25kg Squat Bar, Texas Power Lift
                Bar, Eleiko Power Lift Bar, and Texas Power Lift Bar. We have the bars, platforms, benches, and cages at

                nevertheless quite vital. Additionally, you can be sure that all facets of your strongman training will
                be improved by having a comprehensive assortment of stones, yokes, farmers, sleds, prowlers, and logs
