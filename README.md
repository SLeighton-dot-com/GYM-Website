    *   ### Design
        -   #### Colour Scheme
            -   The two main colours used are gold and black for a contrasting site with black and white photos providing a moody aesthetic.
        -   #### Typography
            -   The Roboto Slab font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

        -   #### Imagery
            -   The large background hero image is intended to be eye-catching and draw users in. It is also relevant to the type of venue the site is for.

    * ### Fixed Bugs

        - Flexbox extending over footer - Fixed by adding ```display: none;``` to the Flexbox items that are no longer needed to be displayed.
        - The main Divs holding information was overlapping nav and footer Divs on decreasing screen sizes - Fixed by changing ```top``` and ```width``` attributes to information Divs with media queries as the screen width decreased.
        - Media queries the setting the ```top``` and ```width``` made the Div's display differently on the deployed site than they did on CodeAnywhere - Fixed by using the deployed site as a reference and changed the px value that the media queries activated.
        - Input form wouldn't action a thank you message and would allow you to submit a blank form - Fixed this issue with an action to open a specific page with a thank you acknowledgement and used the ```required``` setting for both inputs.
        - Using ```height: vh;``` to control Div heights for backgrounds was causing issues when devices were rotated - Fixed by using ```height: px;``` to set Div heights as needed.
